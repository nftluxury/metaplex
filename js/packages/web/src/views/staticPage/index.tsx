We love luxury watches. Here is Switzerland, as well as in several other countries, luxury watches are a subject of statutus, of passion, of love of precision and of timelessness.
In our country, people say that "you do not own the watch, but you are merely the custodian for your next generation".

<p>What better idea than being located in the heart of the watch making industry, which is Geneva, Switzerland.
</p>
<br>
</br>
<br></br>
We are convinced that thhe most valuable time pieces, and even the medium valued watches, have their enthusiasts and their lovers.
Now, thanks to NFT-Luxury, people have now the opportunity, to buy and sell portions of the watches and benefit from their market value appreciation.
This is no longer reserved to watch owners, but also by any person who wish to invest 100 US$, 1'000 US$ or 100'000 US$ and be part of the action.

<br></br> <br></br>

<h2>At NFT-Luxury, you can
</h2>

1.
Buy a watch or sell it, via NFTs (non-fungible tokens), where a watch is separated into 1'000 tradable tokens.
<br></br>
2.
You can finance you watch, by selling only a portion of the tokens attached to the watch you own. This will not only finance you, but also, it will give a market value to your watch.
<br></br>
3.
You can trade NFTs, and just buy and sell them, without ever owning one, and you are just benefitting from the upside on the value of the watch.

<br></br>
<br></br>

We want to ba global player, from the center of the action, which is Geneva, Switzerland.<br></br> 

Our mission is to allow for safe delivery of watches to all participants, if they wish to have a delivery.
We also want to be the best custodian, where we safeguard the watches, while in transit.
